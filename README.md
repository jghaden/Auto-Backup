# Auto-Backup
A program with a basic and easy to understand GUI to quickly and automatically make backups of a given source to a set target.

## How To Use
1. Start by clicking the **Source** button to set the directory you wish to backup
2. Next, click on the **Backup** button to set the path that the backup must be stored
3. Specify the amount of time it should take to perform each back up in the **Timer** field
4. Lastly, click on the green **Enable** button to begin the automatic backup process

## Disclaimer
This code is older than I would like it to be and must be improved. These projects are simply being pushed to GitHub in the event of storage failure. The code will be revisited and much improved in the future (most likely in C++).
